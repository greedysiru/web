<h2>Siru는 누구?</h2>
<p>Siru is my <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/고양이" target="_blank" title="고양이 위키피디아 참">cat</a> and a female who is estimated to be four years old this year.
   She has three colors of fur and it has an irregular pattern. She is usually
    smaller than a cat and weighs about 3 kilograms.
    <strong>Her appearance is <u>cute</u> and <u>ugly.</u></strong></p>

<p>She only sleeps every day.
He is still sleeping behind me.
Maybe after two more hours of sleep, she'll cry for food.</p>
